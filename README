You should use Paket's github dependency to include the ProxILGen.fs file into your
project.

  https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/github-dependencies.html

Or in short:

  github Luiz-Monad/ProxILGen ProxILGen.fs


Also, if you want to compile out-of-the box you can just add Luiz-Monad/ProxILGen.fs to your SCM system.
